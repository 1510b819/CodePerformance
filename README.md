# CodePerformance: Python Script Profiler

CodePerformance is a Python tool for profiling and optimizing Python scripts. It measures the execution time, function call counts, and visualizes performance metrics, helping you identify bottlenecks and optimize your code.
Key Features

    Execution Time Profiling: Tracks total script execution time and compares it against a predefined threshold.
    Function Call Metrics: Analyzes function call frequency and flags functions that are called excessively.
    Visualization: Displays a bar chart of the top 10 most time-consuming functions.
    Performance Warnings: Alerts you if your script or functions exceed performance thresholds.

# Installation

No external libraries are required other than Python's built-in modules. However, if you want to use the visualization feature, you'll need matplotlib. You can install it with:

```bash

pip install matplotlib

```
## Usage

    Clone this repository or download the CodePerformance.py script.

    Use the following command to profile any Python script:

    bash

    python CodePerformance.py <script_to_profile.py>

    Customize the time and call thresholds directly in the CodePerformance.py script or leave them at their default values.

## Example

If you have a script called example_script.py, run:

``bash

python CodePerformance.py example_script.py

``
This will:

    Print performance statistics to the console (execution time and function call counts).
    Generate a bar chart showing the most time-consuming functions.

Parameters

    time_threshold (float): The maximum allowable script execution time (in seconds).
    call_threshold (int): The maximum allowable number of function calls for a function to be considered performant.

## Output Example

After running the profiler, you might see output like this:

```sql

Profiling script: example_script.py
Total Execution Time: 0.1537 seconds
Performance is within the acceptable time limit of 1.0 seconds.


Top 10 Most Time-Consuming Functions:
...
Performance Metrics:
  - Function 'slow_function' is called 1 times.
  - Function 'another_slow_function' is called 1 times.

Script performed well within the time limit.

```
### Why Use CodePerformance?

This tool is perfect for developers, data scientists, or anyone looking to optimize their Python code. By profiling your scripts, you can identify performance bottlenecks, improve efficiency, and ensure that your code is running within acceptable time and memory limits.
